# How to start

This theme is far more simplistic than most themes therefore running `hugo new site` creates a lot of things that are not necessary.

```
mkdir -p myterminalcv/themes
cd myterminalcv
git clone https://github.com/coolapso/hugo-theme-terminalcv themes/terminalcv
cp themes/exampleSite/config.yaml .
hugo server
```

Now you can start personalizing it by changing the config.yaml and when you are happy just build the site with `hugo`

## Recommended way

If you are using git (which you should be!) for your website and don't want to make any radical changes to the theme itself, it's recommended that you add the theme as a submodule. This way, you can easily get new updates when they are available.

``` bash
git submodule add https://github.com/coolapso/hugo-theme-terminalcv.git themes/terminalcv
```

# How to configure

All the content and configuration is done through the [config.yml](config.yml).

you can just copy the existing example file and change it to your liking.

# Faviconss

[RealFaviconGenerator](https://realfavicongenerator.net/) and put the generated files into the static your folder

# Contributions

Improvements and suggestions are always welcome, feel free to open an Issue or Pull Request

If you like this theme and want to support / contribute in a different way you can always:

</a>

# Development

If you just want to make any changes and be able to test them as you progress, or if you simply just want to test the module wihtou having to create a new hugo website you can just run

```
git clone https://github.com/coolapso/hugo-theme-terminalcv
cd hugo-theme-terminalcv
make server
```

if you don't have make, then you can just run:

```
hugo server --config exampleSite/config.yml --theme ""
```
