    content: |
      Here the title and the content can have different colors
      The content can be multi

      line

      And spaces       will be respected as well
      This section will have the default command: misc
      but you can name it something else with the property
      commandName: <String>
      Give it a shot and try and uncomment the line 
      commandName: newcommand
      now instead of misc you can execute the newcommand for this section
      Auto completion will know it too! :D
